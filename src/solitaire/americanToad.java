/**
 * @ American Toad
 * Description: AT is a solitaire game using two decks of playing cards.
 * This game is similar to Canfield except that the Tableau builds down in suit,
 * and a partial Tableau Stack cannot be moved (only the top card or entire stack
 * can be moved). The object of the game is to move all cards to the Foundations.
 *
 * Layout: American Toad has eight Tableau Stacks. Each Tableau Stack contains
 * one card and builds down in suit wrapping from Ace to King. The game includes
 * one Reserve Pile with twenty cards that can be played onto the Tableau or Foundations.
 * There is a deck usually at the bottom right that turns up one card at a time.
 *
 * Rules: One card is dealt onto the first Foundation. This rank will be used
 * as a base for the other Foundations. The Foundations build up in suit, wrapping
 * from King to Ace as necessary. Cards in the Tableau can be moved to a Foundation
 * or onto another Tableau Stack. The Tableau builds down in suit wrapping
 * from Ace to King. Empty spaces are filled automatically from the Reserve.
 * Once the Reserve is empty, spaces in the Tableau can be filled with a card
 * from the Deck, but NOT from another Tableau Pile. When moving Tableau Piles,
 * you must either move the whole pile or only the top card.
